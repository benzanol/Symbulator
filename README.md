Symbulator is a Computer Algebra System combined with a Graphing Calculator written in Scala and transpiled to web using ScalaJS.
This means that performs symbolic manipulations of equations to calculate exact mathematical expressions for zeros, intersections, and integrals.

\\
The right side of the screen contains a number of tabs which allow you to calculate solutions, intersections, derivatives, integrals, maxima/minima, and areas.
This uses the symbolic algebra system to find exact values instead of approximating as most calculators do.
